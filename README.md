# Standarized_test_and_school_data

For this project we are acting as the Chief Data Scientist for a city’s school district. In this capacity, we will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

We’ve been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We’ve been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The primary task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
To do this functions were performed to determine total students, budgets and schools. As well the average math and reading score. The percent of students who passed math and reading in addition to the overall passing percent was also found, this was broken down by school size to determine if there was a relationship between student performance and size of school.
